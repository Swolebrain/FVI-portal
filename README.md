# FVI-portal

##Master Branch
This project started out as a facelift for http://www.fvi.edu but I couldn't get everyone on board with it so I repurposed it and branched it off into the tech-fvi branch.  

##tech-fvi branch
This is a page that was developed in order for FVI to increase its quality scores for our PPC landing page campaigns. We needed Google to stop associating our landing pages with all the health care content present in fvi.edu in order for them to send us traffic. We accomplished this goal by moving the landing pages to the subdomain. This page is meant to be the first impression that fvi tech has on organic traffic. Eventually, all the content from the navbars will be transferred from fvi.edu to the tech.fvi.edu subdomain.

The live version is located at http://tech.fvi.edu
